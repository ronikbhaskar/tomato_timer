## Tangent Towards Timing Tomatoes

A few weeks ago, I learned that "*tomato*" in Italian is "*pomodoro*." Before this, I had only ever heard the word "pomodoro" in the context of the Pomodoro Technique. While I don't fully buy the Pomodoro Technique, I knew I wanted to create something that commented on this, though I later realized that most people that subscribe to the technique probably already knew this.

But that still wasn't enough. So many Romance languages use a word similar to "tomato" to represent the red produce (owing to Nahuatl), but not Italian. It turns out that "pomodoro" comes from "pomo d'oro," which translates to "golden apple" or "golden fruit." This made sense for a bit, and it gave me an idea for renaming "golden apples" to "pomodori" in the video game that makes heavy use of golden apples (you know the one), but then I was confused again. 

If I'm not mistaken (though it is likely that I am), the more common way to say "apple" in Italian is "mela," but "pomo" makes so much more sense, especially in the context of other Romance languages like the word "pomme" in French, which comes from Latin words referencing fruit plucked from trees, or those trees themselves. After looking into it, "mela" likely comes from Vulgar Latin. But the words from which it comes do not mean "apple" or "plucked fruit." Instead, they derive from "malus," roughly meaning "evil." I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to think about why the word "apple" might come from the word "evil."

My other comment is on the fact that they were called "golden." Why? Tomatoes are red, aren't they? Well, they didn't always have that distinct red. Fifteen hundred years ago, it was much less common to find deep red tomatoes. Instead, many were yellow when ripe. This was around the time that tomatoes were being brought back to Europe, thus giving rise to the name "pomodoro."
